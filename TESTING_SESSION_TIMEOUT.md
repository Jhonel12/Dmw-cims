# Testing Session Timeout - Step by Step Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
The frontend was checking cookies on page load and immediately marking users as authenticated, even if the backend token had expired. The background token verification was failing but being ignored.

### The Solution:
1. **Updated `AuthContext.tsx`**: Now properly logs out users when token verification returns 401
2. **Updated `api-client.ts`**: Enhanced error handling to specifically detect `SESSION_EXPIRED` code

## üß™ How to Test (3 Methods)

### Method 1: Browser Test (Recommended)

1. **Start your backend server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Start your frontend** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your app and login**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or your frontend URL)
   - Login with your credentials
   - ‚úÖ You should see the dashboard

4. **Open Developer Console**:
   - Press `F12`
   - Go to "Console" tab
   - You should see logs like:
     - "Initializing auth state"
     - "Token set in API client"

5. **Close the browser tab completely** (not just minimize!)

6. **‚è±Ô∏è WAIT 65-70 seconds** (be patient!)

7. **Reopen your app in a new tab**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   - Watch the Console logs carefully

8. **Expected Results**:
   ```
   Console logs:
   ‚úÖ "Initializing auth state"
   ‚úÖ "401 Unauthorized: Session expired due to inactivity"
   ‚úÖ "Session expired due to inactivity - redirecting to login"
   ‚úÖ "Background token verification failed"
   ‚úÖ "Session expired - logging out user"
   
   Network tab:
   ‚úÖ Request to /auth/me returns 401
   ‚úÖ Response: {"success":false,"message":"Session expired due to inactivity","code":"SESSION_EXPIRED"}
   
   UI:
   ‚úÖ Automatically redirected to login page
   ```

### Method 2: Network Tab Monitoring

1. Login to your app
2. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí **Network tab**
3. Keep the tab open and **do nothing for 65 seconds**
4. Then click on any link or reload the page
5. Look for the `/api/auth/me` request in Network tab
6. Click on it and check:
   - **Status**: 401
   - **Response**: 
     ```json
     {
       "success": false,
       "message": "Session expired due to inactivity",
       "code": "SESSION_EXPIRED"
     }
     ```

### Method 3: cURL Test (Backend Only)

Test the backend directly:

```bash
# 1. Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your@email.com","password":"yourpassword"}'

# Copy the token from the response

# 2. Test immediately (should work)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Response should be successful with user data

# 3. WAIT 65 seconds, then test again (should fail)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Expected response:
# {"success":false,"message":"Session expired due to inactivity","code":"SESSION_EXPIRED"}
```

## üîç Debugging Tips

### If session doesn't expire:

1. **Check backend cache**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   php artisan cache:clear
   ```

2. **Check if middleware is applied**:
   - Open `backend/routes/api.php`
   - Verify protected routes have: `Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'check.token.activity'])`

3. **Check timeout duration**:
   - Open `backend/app/Http/Middleware/CheckTokenActivity.php`
   - Line 28 should be: `$idleTimeout = 60;`

4. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Close all tabs
   - Clear cookies for your app domain
   - Try again

### If you get immediate 401 errors:

1. **Check if you're calling `/auth/me` too frequently**
   - Every call resets the timer
   - Make sure you're not polling it every few seconds

2. **Check your .env file**:
   ```
   CACHE_DRIVER=file
   SESSION_DRIVER=file
   ```

## üìä Expected Console Output

### On Login:
```
‚úÖ Loaded token from storage: true
‚úÖ Token set in API client: true
‚úÖ Initializing auth state
```

### After 1 Minute Idle (when reopening):
```
‚úÖ Loaded token from storage: true
‚úÖ Initializing auth state
‚ùå 401 Unauthorized: Session expired due to inactivity
‚ùå Session expired due to inactivity - redirecting to login
‚ùå Background token verification failed
‚ùå Session expired - logging out user
‚û°Ô∏è [Redirect to /login]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To change the timeout duration, edit:
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Middleware/CheckTokenActivity.php`
**Line**: 28

```php
$idleTimeout = 60;   // 1 minute (current - for testing)
$idleTimeout = 300;  // 5 minutes
$idleTimeout = 900;  // 15 minutes (recommended for production)
$idleTimeout = 1800; // 30 minutes
```

## üéØ What Actions Reset the Timer?

### ‚úÖ Actions that RESET the timer (extends session):
- Loading any protected page
- Fetching OFW records
- Creating/updating clients
- Any API call to routes with `check.token.activity` middleware

### ‚ùå Actions that DON'T reset the timer:
- Calling `/api/auth/check` endpoint (token validation only)
- Public routes (login, register)
- Just having the tab open (no requests)

## üìù Notes

- The timer tracks **actual API requests**, not tab activity
- Closing the tab doesn't immediately expire the session
- Multiple tabs/devices are tracked independently
- Each token has its own activity timer
- The cache stores the timestamp, not the full user data

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. ‚úÖ You can login and use the app normally
2. ‚úÖ After 1 minute of inactivity (no API requests), the next request fails
3. ‚úÖ You see "Session expired due to inactivity" in console
4. ‚úÖ You're automatically redirected to login
5. ‚úÖ You can login again successfully

## üöÄ Ready for Production

Once testing is complete, remember to:
1. Increase timeout to 15-30 minutes
2. Add user-friendly notification/toast when session expires
3. Consider adding a "session about to expire" warning at 30 seconds before
4. Test with multiple concurrent users
5. Monitor cache performance in production
